## The main repository for the 10 week iOS 501 Course.

>Weâ€™re delighted to have you as a member of our Code 501: Advanced Software Development in iOS course. It'll be a lot of work and a lot of fun.
In this course you will study professional techniques and practices as you advance your skills in iOS development. This is the course layout for the 501 iOS Course at Code Fellows.
The first 9 weeks of the course we'll be studying Swift.
This will be followed by a week long project built by students and written in Swift.

## Instructional Staff
* **Adam Wallraff - Lead Instructor**  

### At the end of this course, you will be able to:
* Create mobile apps using Swift 3.
* Use industry tools and frameworks such as Cocoa, Xcode, UIKit, Git, and more.
* Understand and know how to properly use UIKit, asynchronous code, CoreImage, NSURLSession and JSON, MapKit and CoreLocation, AutoLayout, Source Control, Core Data, Animation, and the app submission process.

### Learn with Stacked Modules

> Concepts in each of our courses are taught using stacked modules, where a new concept is introduced in each class session, building upon what came before it. This is a challenging style that requires persistence, practice, and collaboration, but allows more concepts to be introduced over the length of the course. This method helps students learn and retain more information in a short period of time.

  * Speak up when you're stuck for more than 15 minutes
  * **AND:** Above all else, attention to detail.
